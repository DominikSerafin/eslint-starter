# ESLint Starter

ESLint config starter that contains every rule which is disabled on start and commented with description. Create your own config by enabling only the rules you need. 

Inspired by the original [ESLint Reset gist](https://gist.github.com/cletusw/e01a85e399ab563b1236) by [cletusw](https://gist.github.com/cletusw). Unfortunately at the time of writing it wasn't updated with all the new, deprecated & removed rules. This repo was created with intent to fix that.


# Contributing

Contributions are encouraged. The only rule is to keep order of rules as they're authored in [official docs](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/).


# TODO

* Update "Stylistic Issues".
* Update "ECMAScript 6".
* Update descriptions (sync them with official docs).
